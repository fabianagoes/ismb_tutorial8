# Practical 1

Practical 1 focuses on learning representations to encode nucleic acid sequences and using these encodings/representations to train and evaluate simple machine learning models for classification tasks.

# Practical 2

Practical 2 focuses on learning vector representations to encode nucleic acid sequences using word embedding techniques and large language models (LLMs). The learned embeddings are then used to train and evaluate simple machine learning classifiers for sequence-based prediction tasks.
